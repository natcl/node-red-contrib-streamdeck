# node-red-contrib-streamdeck

A Node-RED node to interact with the Elgato Stream Deck products.

Note: this node connects directly to the Stream Deck, it cannot be used in conjunction with Elgato's Stream Deck software which will need to be closed for this node to work.

# Installation

## Local
```
npm install --save node-red-contrib-streamdeck
```

## Global
```
npm install -g node-red-contrib-streamdeck
```

## Linux

On Linux, you will need to add these to `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-elgato.rules` :

```
SUBSYSTEM=="input", GROUP="input", MODE="0666"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0060", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0063", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="006c", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="006d", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0080", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fd9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0090", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"
```

And run `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules`

# Usage

## stream deck in

The input node will allow you to get which keys are pressed on the unit.

The key index will be sent as `msg.topic` as an integer starting from 0. The key state (down or up) will be sent as an integer in `msg.payload`. 1 is down and 0 is up.

## stream deck out

The output node is used to send images to the keys and control various functions.

### Inputs

#### fillImage path | url | buffer
